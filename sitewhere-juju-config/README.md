SiteWhere Juju Example Configurations
-------------------------------------
This folder contains example SiteWhere configurations that may be used
from Juju nodes. If configured with the *config-url* parameter, a 
Juju SiteWhere node will load its configuration from an external 
source. Note that the example files use property placeholders that
are filled in by Juju at runtime based on relationships and configuration
parameters.
