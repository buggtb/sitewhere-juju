  SiteWhere is the Open Platform for the Internet of Things. This charm adds the ability 
  to dynamically load test one or more SiteWhere server instances using a highly configurable 
  load testing framework. SiteWhere load test nodes can be scaled out to push the limits of 
  server configurations, revealing bottlenecks and providing performance numbers for various 
  configurations and environments.
