  SiteWhere is the Open Platform for the Internet of Things. It allows 
  you to manage a large number of devices, communicate with them over 
  many transports and protocols, persist device data in big data storage, 
  and interact with the data via REST services. SiteWhere also provides 
  a comprehensive framework for integrating device data with other 
  systems and performing analytics on the data. The system is designed 
  to scale gracefully to any number of devices and is easily extended 
  to include new types of devices and methods of communication.
